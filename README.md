# JYCore
A Garry's Mod menu system used on our old servers. This project still isn't completely finished but it would serve as a good base
for someone looking to create an all-in-one server management system. However this program is under active development still so
I will be adding different functionality going forward.


## Install
Drag the `jycore` file into your addons directory on your Garry's Mod server: `/garrysmod/addons/`.

**After** all of the files are in the addons directory you just need to run the server and everything should work as intended.


## Config
Inside the `sh_config.lua` file in the root of the addon, you will find all of the settings that you will need to edit to make JYCore
suited to your needs. Inside that file also contains all of the comments to help you change the settings.


## Screenshots
I have included some media of the addon for your convenience.
